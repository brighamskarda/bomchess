# bomchess
A chess library written in modern c++. One of the goals of this library is to implement extended pgn support. There is no common chess library that supports parsing and generating pgns.

Still Under Construction. Check back in ~6 months.

All code should follow my personal style guide found at https://github.com/brighamskarda/style-guide.
